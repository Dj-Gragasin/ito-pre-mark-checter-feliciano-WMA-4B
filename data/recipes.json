      "Ever thought of doing a Filipino twist to Quesadilla? To those who are not familiar with quesadilla, it is simply a tortilla filled with meat and vegetables. This is popular in the Southwest area of the Unites States. Flour or corn tortilla are filled with vegetables, meat, and cheese. The meat used in quesadilla may vary, but the most commonly used is chicken marinated in  southwestern herbs and spices.",
      "I know that most of you have thought of this idea before — I mean to use chicken adobo for quesadilla. How about making a chicken adobo quesadilla? Sounds good to me — and this will also feed your curiosity.Will this be successful, or not? Stay tuned.",
      "This is the first time that I will be publishing my experiments. I am  adventurous when it comes to cooking, and part of the adventure is to try different variations of dishes — even the weirdest. I should have documented my food adventures years ago, but better late than never — or so the saying goes.",
      "For this experiment, I am using boneless chicken breast, bell peppers, onions, Mexican cheese (these are combination of cheeses that I got pre-packaged from the grocery),  flour tortillas, and sour cream. I started by making chicken adobo — and this is quite different from the usual chicken adobo recipe. The chicken breasts were marinated in a mixture of soy sauce, vinegar,  ground black pepper, and garlic powder before cooking. This means that the chicken already has that adobo taste and aroma while still raw.  Interesting? Yes, and it is needed to be that way because we only need to sear the chicken for a few minutes.",
      "While the chicken is marinating, I started to saute the onion and bell peppers. I did this for 3 minutes then placed the vegetables aside.",
      "<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-28378\" src=\"https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/adoboquesadilla-vegetables1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"357\" srcset=\"https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/adoboquesadilla-vegetables1.jpg 520w, https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/adoboquesadilla-vegetables1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/adoboquesadilla-vegetables1-87x60.jpg 87w, https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/adoboquesadilla-vegetables1-141x97.jpg 141w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 730px, (min-width: 1080px) 650px, (min-width: 1024px) 630px, (min-width: 768px) calc(100vw - 40px), calc(100vw - 20px)\" />",
      "After marinating in the adobo mixture for 60 minutes, I started to sear the chicken breasts. I made sure that the chicken is fully cooked while still retaining the moisture inside.",
      "The next step is to slice the chicken. However, make sure to let the chicken rest  for a while to retain the moisture. I simply sliced the chicken into small serving pieces. I also tried to taste a piece — it was a delicious chicken adobo according to my taste buds.",
      "Next was to grab a piece of flour tortilla and lay it flat on a greased heated pan. I started to assemble the quesadilla by putting the chicken adobo, sauteed vegetables, cheese, and sour cream over the the tortilla. I also topped the ingredients that I arranged with another tortilla that I preheated a while ago. It is important that  the two tortillas are flattened together — just like a panini. So, I used a spatula to press the tortillas together (and the image on the very top of this article is what it looked like).",
      "As far as I am concerned, the experiment was a success. I thought that chicken adobo collaborated well with the other ingredients. I enjoyed my Chicken Adobo Quesadilla and I plan to make more in the future.",
      "Now, I’m trying to think of a new food experiment. My brain is kinda rusty today, you can help me think by posting your suggestions in the comments.",

      "When done right, grilled pork chops can be very succulent and flavorful. It all depends on your pork cut, seasoning and getting the cooking temperature and times right. Whether you use a charcoal or gas grill, you can learn how to grill pork chops perfectly at home.",
      "The first important lesson in learning how to grill pork chops is to know your pork cuts. You don’t have to know each one by name; just how the thickness and amount of fat affects the flavor and cooking times. There are two major types of pork cuts: bone-in and boneless. Bone-in pork chops are known for being tenderer than the boneless variety, but they also cook for longer.",
      "Some pork has more fat around the meat than others. Fattier pork chops can handle high heat better than leaner cuts. Lean cuts often need to be moistened with sauces and marinades to keep them from becoming dry. Breading is also an effective method of cooking lean chops. Pork is best when fresh, but frozen can work just as well if defrosted in the fridge or in cool water ahead of time.",
      "Before you send your pork chops to the grill, it is important to season them properly. Brining – a process of soaking meat in salt water overnight – is a great way to tenderize thick pork cuts. You simply add a tablespoon of salt for every cup of water into a bowl, and a tablespoon of sugar if you like pork sweeter. Marinades are ideal for lean cuts. Alternatively, you can put together a dry rub of fresh herbs and spices, or simply salt and pepper.",
      "Once you’ve brined, marinated or rubbed your pork chops, you can pre-heat the grill or turn the heat up to medium-heat on the stove.",
      "If you’re using a grill, add the pork chops and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side. If pork chops are very thick, add an additional minute. If using a pan, make sure the chops fit comfortably in the pan and do not touch. Cook for 3-4 minutes on either side as well. Serve.",
      "In general, medium chops should reach at least 145F when a meat thermometer is inserted into the thickest part. For well done, the ideal temperature is 160F and above. A cut ½-inch is usually cooked in 6-8 minutes and 8-10 minutes for ¾ inch cuts. For pork cuts thicker than 1 ¼-inch, the recommended cooking time is 20 minutes to half an hour.",
      "Instead of high-sodium marinades, you can make your own at home. For sweet pork chops, you can combine a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, two tablespoons of olive oil and ¼ cup of honey. For a saltier marinade, soy sauce and a little garlic can go a long way. If you brined your chops beforehand, there is no need to add extra salt. Learn how to grill pork chops and serve with baked potatoes and vegetable sides.",

Learning how to make beef jerky is a great way to put leftover meat to good use. It is low in calories, loaded with nutrients and can hold hunger back until your next meal.",
      "Beef jerky is mostly made from beef in the United States. However, other countries use pork, turkey and even game. Being a beef by-product, this snack is rich in iron and protein. Phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc and copper are also found in jerky. This means it is very healthy for those suffering from high blood pressure, weak muscle and bone and fatigue. Please note that beef jerky can be very salty and usually contains a lot of sodium.",
      "Learning how to make beef jerky is a fun process. You can use a dehydrator if you have one. If not, dry meat the old-fashioned way in the oven or in the sun. Don’t be timid about your seasoning. Experiment with different spices to make great flavors.",

      "Cut your meat into thin 1/20-inch slices or strips. Because this can be a challenging task, it is best for beginners to ask a butcher to do this.",
      "Create a seasoning or marinade for your beef jerky. Season your meat strips and leave inside the fridge for 12-24 hours. To make a Filipino version, try using our marinade for beef tapa.",
      "Once the seasoning has sunk into the meat, place meat strips in a dehydrator. Alternatively, dry meat in an oven set at 165 F. If you’re using a dehydrator, dry the meat for 2-6 hours. If you’re using the oven, it should be dried in 1-3 hours.",
      "When meat is dried to your liking, store it in the fridge or in vacuum-sealed bags to enjoy in your own time.",
      "Removing fat off the meat is crucial. The more fat there is on meat, the faster the beef jerky will spoil. To get as much fat off as possible, try freezing the meat beforehand. Frozen fat is easier to trim and makes cutting meat into strips a lot simpler too.",
      "Beef jerky can be seasoned with a variety of marinades and ingredients. Salt, pepper, chili peppers, hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce and barbeque spice are just a few seasoning suggestions you can try. For those who prefer sweet beef jerky, you can marinate meat in honey and even brown sugar. Keep in mind that the longer your meat is marinated, the longer it will take to dry.",
      "Learning how to make beef jerky is a great skill to acquire. Beef jerky is a low-calorie snack that offers many nutrients in small bites. You can make it within hours in your kitchen, and try delicious seasonings to find your favorite.",

      "One of the best things about having a barbeque is enjoying crisp grilled chicken. While some cut it into pieces to make cooking easier, whole chickens make a delectable presentation for guests. Grilling a whole chicken has long been a challenge for many. However, with a few winning techniques, you can learn how to grill chicken perfectly.",
      "You have two options: cutting chicken into pieces, and grilling it whole. The benefit of cutting chicken is that you can trim the fat off the pieces easily. To prep whole chicken, on the other hand, needs a technique called “butterflying”. To butterfly, press the chicken flat on the kitchen top to expose its thighs and legs. Use sheers or kitchen scissors to cut out the spine.",
      "From there, rub your blend of seasoning on the skin, under it and inside the chicken if you prefer. To make seasoning, you can combine spices, herbs, salt, butter and any flavor you enjoy. It is common knowledge that baby chickens are generally less flavorful than larger ones. Therefore, when shopping for a bird, choose the large variety.",
      "Knowing how to grill chicken whole is not as hard as you might think. Have your grill ready, keep all utensils within arm’s reach and follow these simple steps.",
      "<img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-28029 size-full\" src=\"https://panlasangpinoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/grill-chicken.jpg\" alt=\"grilling chicken\" width=\"500\" height=\"333\" />",
      "Once you’ve prepped your chicken for the grill, prepare your fire. If you’re using coal, set it up so that one side is cooler than the other. To do this, you can pile more coals on one side of the grill than the other. Whichever type of grill you use, make sure there are two heat zones.",
      "Setting up two heat zones is an important lesson in knowing how to grill chicken. This is because white meat cooks faster than meat on the legs. Another important reason is that you first have to cook meat and then crisp the skin under high heat later.",
      "Before you add the chicken to the grill, make sure it is clean. Use an onion or cleaning agent to wash the grill bars and oil them so chicken does not stick. Spread the bird over the grill with the breast on the coolest side and legs on the warmer. A recommended technique is to cover a brick with foil and place it on top of the chicken for more even cooking.",
      "The biggest challenge for people who don’t know how to grill chicken is burning it. It can be hard to tell if chicken is thoroughly cooked or not. The best way to know if your meat is ready is when it doesn’t stick to the grill. Chicken oozes fat as it cooks, which makes it stick to the grill bars. Be patient and keep unruly flames under control. Remember to grill the meat first and crisp the skin last.",
      "Grilling chicken, especially whole chicken, can be effortless. By mastering the basics of how to grill chicken, you can prepare crisp, tasty meals for you and your guests. Prep your bird using the butterfly method, season it, use a brick to cook it evenly, crisp it and enjoy.",

It has now been in the 5 most significant varieties of fish in terms of fish farming.Due to this, hundreds of different Tilapia Recipes are made available for us.",
      "Cooking tilapia is similar to cooking any other fish. You have to prepare it based on the dish that you plan to cook before execution. This means cleaning the fish by removing the scales, gills, and innards before anything else. We all have different ways of preparation. For example: after cleaning, I rub salt all over the before frying it. If being grilled directly over heat, I leave the scales in so that it won’t stick on the grill.Most Tilapia Recipes mention that the fish needs to be cleaned, it is important to understand that cleaning the tilapia means removing the internal organs and gills — not just washing it with water.",
      "In the Philippines, there are countless tilapia recipes available in every region.

      "To sear or searing the chicken means to scorch the surface with an intense amount of heat to a point where it is nearly burnt. This method cooks the outer part of the chicken real fast while preserving the juice and flavor inside. It only takes a few minutes to cook both sides of the chicken (make sure to add a few more minutes to ensure that heat reaches the center of the meat); this can be compared to the time spent in frying boneless chicken slices. As for the mixed vegetables, I always use packaged frozen mixed veggies. All I do is melt butter in a pan and put-in the vegetables.",

      "Chicken Marsala is a delicious chicken dish made from chicken slices – usually the breasts – mushrooms, and Marsala wine. The wine is an essential part of the recipe because it adds flavor to the dish.",
      "This wine is high in alcohol, and usually used for cooking. Its name was derived from a Sicilian city. Marsala wine is made from white grapes. At the middle of fermentation, grape brandy is added when the residual sugar are in the anticipated levels. Do not be alarmed about the alcohol content of the wine. You see, all the alcohol evaporates as the wine is heated leaving only the flavor.",
      "Preparing this dish is very easy. It only takes a little time to prepare the ingredients before cooking. It will only take about 30 minutes to completely cook this dish.",
      "You will notice that the recipe calls for olive oil and butter. Since the butter gets burnt easily when heated for a long time, olive oil is added to balance the smoking point. The term smoking point refers to the temperature wherein oil begins to breakdown and produce smoke.",
      "This Chicken Marsala Recipe can be served with pasta, bread, or even steamed rice. This is usually topped over cellophane noodles or linguine similar to Beef Stroganoff Recipe. I like to eat this with steamed white rice, or with whole grain pasta.",
      "Try this recipe and let us know what you think.",

I don’t want to speak for myself; it will be better if you’ll be the judge. Remember the burger steak recipe that we posted a few months ago? It was really good, isn’t it? Well, the idea came from that recipe. One ingredient that made the burger steak recipe stand-out was the onion soup mix.",

      "To tell you the truth, I was clueless when I did the experiment. I had and extra onion soup mix sitting in the food pantry for months. I thought that I should use it before it expires. Having the burger steak recipe in mind, I thought of adding the soup mix to the meatloaf blend that I was mixing. I am not expecting anything amazing to happen – just the addition of a little oniony flavor – I guess. However, the outcome was surprising. The meatloaf had the full flavor that I always wanted.",
      "You can make meatloaf sandwich out of it, or eat it with steamed rice. Better yet, you can try eating it as it is – just like what I did. So, how good is this meatloaf recipe? Let’s just say that we consumed it directly from the loaf pan after baking. The remaining slice that you see in the picture is what’s left of my share – and it was still hot. I had it sit for a while so that I can take a picture, and then I realized that I was already munching it.",

You see, there are days wherein all you want to do is lie down and relax.

      "The trick to make the chicken breasts tender is to pound it using a kitchen mallet until it flattens a little bit. Once you know that the chicken is tender, it is time to start cooking. Start by seasoning the chicken with some salt and pepper; dipping it in the beaten egg mixture before dredging in flour; and deep frying until crispy. Once done, place it in between two slices of buns then add mayonnaise and lettuce. Simple isn’t it?",

      "I was saying a while ago that you can save money while enjoying your meal. That is absolutely true and this sandwich is the proof. Instead of buying pre-cooked roast beef in the deli shop (price ranges from $5 to $10 a pound), I bought 2 lbs of beef (it was on sale for $2.49 a pound) and I made my own roast beef by following our Roast Beef Recipe post.",
      "If you will make your own roast beef, the key here is to slice the meat as thin as possible. You can do it easily with a sharp knife. Based on experience, I find it easy to slice meats when they are fresh from the fridge. The other ingredients are pretty much common: lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. I used iceberg lettuce for this sandwich and topped it with freshly sliced tomatoes. As for the cheese, I would recommend you to use your favorite type of cheese; although, I used American cheese for this sandwich. As for the spread, any type of spread will do as long as you like it. Olive oil based mayonnaise is the generic spread that I use most of the time.",

Corned beef comes in two forms: the brined or salted beef and the canned minced or chunky beef (which is also called bully beef). Brined beef are salt cured beef; these are common in countries such as Canada and the United States. This is the kind that you usually get from the deli shops. Canned Corned Beef, on the other hand, refers to minced or chunked beef with a little gelatin. This type of corned beef are pre-cooked and sealed in a tin can – the same one enjoyed in the Philippines.",

      "As expected, the meal was satisfying. I bought a Filipino brand canned corned beef and it took me less than 10 minutes to do the cooking.",
      "Do you ever bother to read the fine prints in the can? If you do, you might have noticed that most (if not all) of the Filipino brand corned beefs are imported from Brazil or Argentina. Yes, they have good quality cattle there; but, I wonder why these Filipino companies need to import corned beef instead of producing them locally? If they produce these locally, many Filipinos would benefit including farmers and small business owners. This will also help move the economy.",
      "It might have something to do with “lesser costs translate to maximum profits” reasons or it might have something to do with the ability of the Philippines to produce quality meats that will fit or surpass the standards? What do you think?",

      "Let’s not talk about Orange chicken and Chow Mein for now because my attention is focused solely on Beijing Beef. However, you might want to check our Orange Chicken recipe post if you want to know more about it. As for the Chow Mein, the closest recipe that we have is the Pancit Canton- which I think is a better alternative.",
      "There isn’t really anything extra-ordinary about the Beijing Beef – but I still like to have it once in a while. The flavor is probably the main reason why I like it. I am a fan of sweet and sour pork and this dish is pretty much similar – that is if you raise it to the next level. You’ll understand what I’m trying to say once you try one. After the first bite, the tangy taste immediately permeates in your mouth leaving you speechless – looking forward to the next bite. Since the flavor is so rich, it is advisable to balance it by having some sides (such as rice or noodles) while munching. The texture is unique compared to the other Chinese beef dishes that I had, so far. It also has the consistency of a fried flank steak but tender when chewed.",

      "I guess what drove me to try this the first time was their massive advertising campaign. I got curious and eager to try this dish (which was a new addition during that time) to check the validity of their claim: Crispy, Tangy Tasty. Well…it is.",
      "The next reason is probably the fact that I associate Panda Express with Chowking. My family enjoys the foods served in Chowking and we usually try to dine-in at least twice a month when we were still back home. Even though there are a lot of differences between the two, there isn’t any Chinese fast food resto in Chicago that I can compare Chowking with in terms of commercialization and accessibility (good thing our kababayans in California and Las Vegas can check-out the real deal.

There are weeks wherein the average temperature ranges between 5 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit; there are also days where it falls below zero (not to mention the wind chill factor which makes it colder). During this season, a single cup of hot chocolate or coffee really helps in making oneself warm. Hot soups and porridge are also ideal for dinner.",
      "While I was driving home from work last night, I suddenly thought of having Goto (Filipino porridge) for dinner. My craving was so intense that I immediately checked the freezer after arriving hoping for some extra ox tripe. Wait, we haven’t gone to the grocery yet for the week – I realized. All that’s left are pork bellies and some beef brisket. How about chicken? There has to be at least a leg quarter somewhere; I’m planning to make Arroz Caldo instead. It turned out that I used the last chicken leg quarter for another dish a few days before. I’m pretty sure that I won’t make any pork belly porridge – I’m just not a fan of the combination. How about some Beef Lugaw instead (or whatever they call it)?",
      "I haven’t tried making porridge or congee from beef brisket before: this can be a good experiment. I thawed the last pound of beef brisket that I got from the freezer and cubed it. I grabbed my ever reliable pressure cooker and started sautéing some garlic and chopped onions then added the beef right away. A few cups of water were also added before the pot was sealed. I wanted the meat to be very tender so I let it cook for more than 30 minutes. Times up – now the pressure needs to be released from the pot right away; there’s nothing like the old fashioned method of placing the pot under running cold water. I added some spices and flavorings and some cups of water more and off it goes to the stove top to boil again. Lastly, a few cups of rice were added to complete the process. I really don’t know how to call this dish; beef lugaw sounds nice – you think?",

      "Do you know why it is called such even if corn is not used in making corned beef? Actually, corned beef refers to a method of curing beef which is also one of the oldest methods. This method uses grains of coarse salt that are called “corns”. Corned beef also comes in different arrays. Sliced corned beef is popular in North America while finely ground corned beef is the favorite in the Philippines.",
      "I used a Filipino brand chunky corned beef (though it was imported from Brazil) for this meal. I’m not sure if you also do the same thing in cooking corned beef. I usually fry the potatoes first then set it aside while I sauté the onions. I add the beef with then let it stand for a while then put-in the fried potatoes and continue cooking everything for an additional minute or two. Sounds simple? – It is. When I wanted some sauce in it, I just add some water and stew the beef with some chopped potatoes.",

      "Also known as Barbecue isaw, grilled chicken intestine is a mainstay in the side-streets of Metro Manila. This food has been one of the famous street foods since time immemorial. According to some sources, Filipinos started to eat the innards of poultry (specifically chicken) way back during the Spanish colonial era.",
      "Spain colonized the Philippines for more than 300 years and during those days Filipinos are the lowest class in society. They are often made “alipin” or slaves and forced to work for the colonizers. When a household kills a chicken for dinner, all the good parts are consumed by the masters while the remaining parts such as innards and feet are partaken by the slaves.",
      "Chicken intestine is grilled over charcoal and usually basted with a mixture of soy sauce, garlic, salt, pepper, ketchup, and cooking oil. I must admit that this is a bizarre piece of stuff and people who have no idea about it would think that this is crazy. If you ask me I would say “Yes” it is crazy…definitely crazy in a good way. One would never appreciate the taste of food just by looking at it. It may look gross for some while enticing to others.",
      "Have I mentioned that Chicken intestine is best served with vinegar mixed with chopped red onions, crushed garlic, peppercorn, soy sauce, and chili? I like mine well done so that I could feel the crunchiness while chewing. Sometimes I soak it in the vinegar mixture for about five minutes before eating to taste the wonderful flavor of the sauce. I’m really craving for Isaw ng Manok, anyone know where to get some raw chicken intestines in Chicagoland?",

It really depends on your tolerance to heat. However, if you love the heat and more spice to your ginataang baka, I suggest to have an extra sauce on the side with crushed pepper and the condiment of your choice so that you can adjust the taste before you eat. It is always a good idea to keep the spice level of the dish manageable enough to the person with the lowest tolerance to heat that you will be sharing it with.",

      "Ginataang Salmon or Salmon sa Gata is a type of Filipino fish stew wherein salmon is used the main ingredient. The process involves stewing salmon in coconut milk mixture. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach can be added towards the end of the cooking process.",
      "Any type of fish can be used to for this recipe. I utilized frozen salmon fillets for this demonstration. These were the ones that you can purchase from your local grocery store that were packaged in individual air-tight wraps. Make sure to thaw (defrost) it first before cooking. Salmon belly or even salmon head will work when used in this recipe. I mentioned in the video below that any fish variety of your choice can be used as a substitute to salmon. I have tried using boneless bangus, galunggong, and tilapia using this recipe. All of these instances went well.",
      "Note that I am using a special coconut recipe mix for this recipe. It is called Knorr Ginataang Gulay Recipe Mix. This ingredient provides almost all the flavor to the dish. Notice that I did not use either salt nor fish sauce (patis)? I already got the flavors that I want for my ginataang isda. No need to add more, except probably for some ground black pepper to add a little zing to the dish.",

However, people would rather buy this from the grocery store or order it from a restaurant, instead of cooking at home from scratch. I think that the reason behind it is the tedious process of preparing the dish. While the cooking steps are simple and straightforward, the preparation takes time and effort.",

      "This Crispy Baked Chicken Wings Recipe is simple and easy to make. There is nothing fancy about this dish. All I did was to add salt and garlic powder as seasonings and then cooked the wings until brown and crispy. This makes a good appetizer that can be enjoyed with your favorite dipping sauce. I like it with fresh ranch dressing.",
      "Here is how I did it. First is to ensure that the chicken wings are cut properly. I divided a piece into three parts: the drumette (upper part), flat (middle part), and the tip (bottom part without meat). Only the drumette and flat cuts will be used for this recipe. The tip can be discarded or can be kept for future use. The tip can be used to make chicken stock, but you will need a good amount to make a decent tasting stock.",
      "Salt and garlic powder were rubbed all over the chicken. This helps add flavor to it. I usually let the wings rest for at least 15 minutes after rubbing so that the seasoning will have enough time to penetrate the meat. Next is to pan-fry each wing to provide texture to its outer part.",

      "This might sound unnecessary, but I add a few tablespoons of water into the pan while frying the chicken. It needs to be sealed using the pan cover to trap the steam. This process is important because it somewhat steams the fried wings. The texture of the wings after the process will be on the soft side. However, this slowly gets crispy once baked in the oven.",

I don’t really eat like this all the time, at least for breakfast though. However, I needed more energy today and the next few weeks to come.",
      "Let me share with you the good news. We will be moving to a new house soon. I am excited about the kitchen because it is bigger and brighter. I also get to have a decent sized kitchen Island. This is what I was hoping for the longest time. All the cleaning and other tasks related to the move keeps all of us busy for the past few days. A good and heavy breakfast is a must to keep us going.",
      "Note that this recipe calls for T-bone steak, but you can also use Porterhouse or any steak cuts that you like. I emphasized the two steaks cuts above to discuss the difference between the two. Both T-bone and Porterhouse steaks can be distinguished by the “T” shaped bone. However, each has its own properties that make it unique.",
      "Both steak cuts are derived from the short loin. T-bone is the cut from the front loin, while Porterhouse comes from the back, near the tenderloin. This means that porterhouse steak has more tenderloin content to the point that it can be sliced to become a filet mignon.",

      "Let’s discuss how I cooked this steak. I simply used a frying pan to cook my steak, no grilling needed. I suggest rubbing salt all over the steak and letting it stay for at least 15 minutes. This will let the meat absorb it better. You can season with ground black pepper once the steak is cooked, but it is not mandatory. You’ll be surprised on how easy it is to cook your breakfast steak.",
      "The eggs, on the other hand, were fried using the normal way. You can season these if you want. Aside from frying, feel free to cook the eggs based on the way that you prefer. This article about 10 ways to cook eggs might be able to help.",

      "Most Filipinos prepare fried food because it is quicker to cook and it saves us the hassle of menu planning. On a busy day, one can simple season any meat and fry it eventually. While this recipe requires the meat to be marinated for a while, it is a good idea to marinate more than enough pork chops for future use. Simple freeze the extra marinated pork and take it out when needed. Now that’s convenience and pleasure at the same time.",
      "I liked how pork chops in the Philippines are cut. The fat and skin are retained with the meat. This cut is not common here in the Midwest because the fat and skin portions are usually trimmed-off. This was the reason why I had to shoot this video when I was in Manila. It was worth it, and the result was delicious!",

      "This might sound like a very ordinary dish. Well, it is, but there are some pointers that I want to share in order to get the optimal result out of your fried pork chop. Your dish should be tender, moist, and tasty. The tasty part has something to do with the marinade, while the texture (tender and moist) is achieved on the cooking process. Simply marinate the pork for at least 3 hours for it absorb flavor. Marinating overnight is highly recommended. Cooking the pork in medium heat on a lesser amount of time guarantees its tenderness and the inside will likely be moist. Overcooked pork chops are tough, which makes it harder to chew.",

      "I consider this as a basic recipe for pork caldereta. It has the minimum ingredients that will enable you to complete the dish. The main sources of flavors are pork and liver spread. This means that the seasonings (salt and pepper) will play an important role to enhance the overall flavor of the dish. When you watch the video below, you will notice that I emphasized adding more salt to bring-out the flavor from the meat. Make sure to take it easy on it though as we do not want our dish to be very salty.",
      "The secret to a successful Calderetang Baboy has something to do with both flavor and texture. I already talked about how to provide flavor to the dish. The texture part has something to do with the pork and vegetables. The pork should be very tender. The vegetables should not be overcooked to the point that it gets mushy.",

      "It is easy to make Spicy Tokwat Baboy. All you need to do is boil the pig ears until tender, fry the tofu, and prepare the spicy vinegar mixture. However, I strongly recommend to ensure that the ears are properly cleaned before doing anything else.",
      "So, what do I do about it? I boil it twice. The first is to remove the impurities on the skin. I also scrape the hair and top skin of the ears after the first boiling. The second boiling process is about making the ears tender while making it less pungent. Adding cinnamon bark and lemon grass helps reduce the unwanted smell. Crushed ginger root can also be added if desired.",
      "The pig ears are then sliced into serving pieces. These are combined with the sliced tofu that were fried. Speaking of tofu, it is the simplest to cook. Simply fry each side for 4 to 5 minutes (or deep fry for 5 minutes), and then slice into cubes. I have a piece of advice in order to prevent oil from splattering. Try to dry the tofu before frying. I did it wiping each piece of tofu with dry paper towel.",

However, this is not your ordinary boiled beef soup. It is tastier and full of flavor. This can mainly be attributed to the oxtail, which is known to be one of the most flavorful part of the cow. There are also additional ingredients that helped provide more flavor to the dish.",
      "If you have not tried making this dish yet, I suggest that you consider making one soon so that you can enjoy it the same way I did. If you are new to cooking, please do not get intimidated. This is one of the simple dishes fit for beginners. All you need to do is follow the recipe below (step-by-step) and watch the cooking video for additional guidance. I will appreciate if you can provide your feedback by commenting below.",
      "The good thing about this dish is that you don’t need to sauté any ingredient. Let me quickly tell you how I cooked my oxtail soup. I started by boiling water in a cooking pot. The oxtails were pre-boiled for a certain amount of time until scums and fats separate and float. The beef gets partially cooked during the process. I then discarded the water used to boil the oxtail and pour a clean batch to replace the initial. You can boil the beef using the traditional way, which will eat 2 to 3 hours of your time. Using a pressure cooker is also a good option because it can tenderize the beef quickly, thus saving you time.",
      "The meat needs to be tender first before adding the vegetables. This is the reason why the veggies are added towards the end of the cooking process usually before the seasons are put-in.",

The inside is moist and soft. The flavors are also great. I can taste the rich cheese  which was complemented by the saltiness of the ham. The chicken blends in perfect harmony with the filling. The plus here is the Dijon Cream Sauce. It’s creamy tart taste went well with the dish.",

It is mostly similar to Ginataang Halo-halo,except that the latter uses glutinous rice balls or bilo-bilo as part of the ingredient. In addition, binignit suggests the use of Muscovado sugar and “landang” (also known as palm flour jelly balls). These ingredients makes it different.",
      "Cooking binignit is quick and easy. Everything should be straightforward provided that all the ingredients are prepared beforehand. Tapioca pearl is what I used in this recipe as an alternative to landang. Although it has no taste at all, it does give this dish a nice texture and helps make it look more appetizing. This is the ingredient that should be prepare beforehand because It will take a bit of time to prepare sago (Filipino term for tapioca pearl). It has to be boiled for a few minutes and soaked in cold water. As long as your sago is ready, everything should be in a breeze.",
      "I enjoy eating binignit because it has the right amount of sweetness and I can easily distinguish the flavors from each ingredient.

      "Before you start cooking, let me first give you some tips. The first thing that I did was to soak the mung beans in water overnight. This makes the monggo softer, thus quicker to cook. I did this by pouring the beans in a large bowl and added around 3 to 4 cups water.",
      "Small thin slices of pork belly are perfect for this recipe. The fat from the belly can be extracted once the pork is seared. It will be used to saute the onion and garlic — additional oil won’t be needed. Thinly sliced pork are quicker to cook and gets tender easily. It will save you time.",

      "The secret for a good popcorn chicken has something to do with the coating, heat of the oil, and frying time. I always double coat the chicken in all-purpose flour. This methods helps develop the popcorn-like appearance after frying. The temperature of the oil should not be too hot. This will prevent the coating from browning quickly leaving the chicken partially cooked. The frying time should also be just right so that the chicken is thoroughly cooked while tender and the coating is crisp. The magic number is 3 to 5 minutes depending on the size of the cut.",

      "Cooking beef tinola is easy. It will be more convenient to use a pressure cooker when trying to make the beef tender because it saves a lot of time. A 2 to 3 hour boiling time can be reduced to a mere 35 to 40 minutes. This means that you can make this dish for everyone to enjoy in under 1 hour.",
      "I understand that most of us want our soup to be tasty and flavorful. The flavor from the meat itself may not be enough for this to happen. This is the reason why beef broth and other seasonings, such as patis (fish sauce) is added to the soup. You can also use water if beef broth is not available, but I suggest to add a piece of beef cube (bouillon) into it for flavor.",

      "I consider this pancit version special, not only because of the noodles, but also with the medley of other ingredients. It has both pork and chicken, and there are also pan-fried shrimp added to it — not to mention the combination of different vegetables. It is amazing.",
      "In addition, I also like the idea that this can be prepared quickly. Yes, it can still be considered as a short order. Provided that the shredded chicken is prepared beforehand, Pancit Canton at Bihon can be cooked in less than 30 minutes. This means that you can quickly make it in a spur of the moment when ingredients are available.",

      "Crab and Corn Soup along with Golden Chicken Rice Balls is a great tasting food combination that you can make for Chinese New Year. This has both the good taste and nice texture that can make your eating experience more pleasurable.",
      "Preparing the chicken rice ball is not that hard. Unlike in making regular meatball, this might take a little bit getting used to, but you should be able to master the technique after doing it once.",
      "The first thing that I did was to cook the ground chicken. The cooked chicken was combined with sushi rice and mixed. The mixture should be sticky enough to hold everything together. The next step is to form the mixture into a ball. This step is somewhat tricky because the mixture tends to stick on your palm. I used a regular sized ice cream scoop to mold and hold the chicken rice balls. This also gives me the opportunity to easily stuff it with cheese. The coating is composed of egg, all-purpose flour, and Panko breadcrumbs.",

      "One thing that you should remember when deep frying breaded food is to always control the temperature of the oil. Breadcrumbs can get burnt quickly, so make sure to start with a lower temp and adjust it accordingly based on the situation. Once the chicken rice ball turns golden brown, it is ready.",
      "Cooking the Crab and Corn Soup is the quickest and easiest. Simply combine water and crab and corn soup mix in a pot, and then stir.

      "Making pork siomai is easy. All you have to do is combine all the siomai ingredients in a bowl and mix together until everything is well blended. Once ready, you can quickly wrap the meat mixture into individual siomai wrappers and steam until done. This recipe makes use of Knorr Pork Cube as an ingredient in the siomai mixture. Some of you might not be accustomed in using this ingredient on dishes such as this, but I am telling you now that it  can help make your siomai stand out. It will taste meatier to the point that you won’t need to use additional condiments. However, it will be better if you enjoy your pork siomai with all the bells and whistles, you know – topped with chili garlic sauce and dipped in toyo with calamansi.",
      "Talking about enjoying your food and having a better eating experience, I think that pairing siomai with egg drop soup is a good idea. After devouring a piece of pork siomai, I like to follow through with a sip of soup. It helps balance the flavor in my palate while making me feel comfy. I feel like my taste buds are being pampered. At the same time, it somewhat tells my mind to that I am ready for for the next round of yummy siomai.",

      "I have been a fan of siomai, in general, since I was a child. Pork siomai is my favorite. I love having it with lots of chili garlic sauce on top and a dip composed of soy sauce, calamansi, and crushed siling labuyo. Chili garlic sauce is something that help increase my appetite when eating siomai. Not only does it taste good, it also has the right amount of spice that goes well with my steamed siomai. This is the reason why I always make my own chili garlic sauce at home. I will be sharing the recipe and video of it soon.",

It is simply made-up of ground pork cooked with the vegetables mentioned, along with raisins and Worcestershire sauce. The filling can be a main dish by itself. I often have it with rice and fried egg. However, we will be using it as an empanada filling,or stuffing, for this recipe.",

All you have to do in the entire process is to add the ingredients at the proper time, and ensure that the rice does not stick on the pan, by continually stirring every 5 minutes.",

      "There were lots of good memories with congee during my childhood. Everytime I get sick, either my grandma or my mom will make some for myself. They would first cook plain lugaw and top it with rousong, which is a type of dried pork with thin strands. I will try a small amount, and then request if they can instead cook chicken congee. Since I was not feeling well, they would always give in to my request. There were even times when I pretend to not feel well just to have chicken congee for breakfast.",
      "I like this version of chicken congee because I can easily eat the chicken along with the rice porridge. There is no need for me to separate the chicken meat from the bone while eating, because it was already done during the cooking process. It also has that yummy chicken taste that makes me feel comfy. I do feel better after having a serving of this dish.",

The variety of vegetables are just icing on the cake, so to speak.",
      "I remember when I was a kid, my dad would take me around Manila to shop for tools. During every trip, he will bring me to this small restaurant, which he simply refers to as  “restawran”. The place serves many different kinds of pancit, and other dishes, which are freshly prepared while you wait. He would point to the short-order sign on the wall and order pancit canton. I was not sure back then what “short order” means, but I learned, as I grew-up, that this refers to dishes that can be cooked quickly and served. This brings me to another reason why I like Shrimp and Chicken Pancit Canton, it is fast to cook and can even be quicker if all ingredients are prepped ahead of time.",
      "The condiments that I use for my pancit canton is a mixture of soy sauce and calamansi, but sometimes I add a piece of crushed fresh siling labuyo.  Lime or lemon are my alternatives these days, because fresh calamansi is not always available here in Chicago. I like how an already flavorful and delicious dish becomes even more interesting when the combination of soy sauce and calamansi is added. I would quickly work on my pancit the moment the soy sauce touches it, without paying attention if it is still hot, or cool enough to handle. I will then finish my meal with a bottle of ice cold soda.",

      "Let’s talk about the components of this recipe. I used fresh shrimp (without shell) and shredded chicken, that I previously boiled. While fresh shrimp is nice to have, you can also use frozen shrimp, or pre-cooked frozen shrimp. For the chicken, I combined pieces of chicken thigh with 4 cups of water and boiled it for 18 minutes. The boiled chicken needs to be cooled down before the meat can be shredded. I also used a piece of Chinese sausage, which I chopped into small pieces, to provide additional flavor to the pancit.",

Why make homemade pork and beans then, if it can be bought ready-to-eat? This recipe is different from the usual because it makes use of double smoked bacon. It has a distinct flavor, coupled by a sweet and tangy taste, that resembles barbecue.",
      "The image below shows the ingredients for this homemade pork and beans recipe. We will not use an entire slab of smoked bacon, only a small portion, which will be cut into small cubes. The yellowish powder that you see is mustard powder, while the thick black liquid are molasses. It is a sweet liquid used in cooking and baking.",
      "Of course tomato sauce, vinegar, and onion are also part of the recipe. By the way, I used canned Cannellini beans (also known as Navy beans). Using canned beans will save you time because these are already pre-cooked and tender.",

      "Cooking pork and beans starts by sauteing the onion. I cook the onions to a point that it is somewhat caramelized before, I add the cubed bacon. The next step is to prepare the sauce. I do this by adding the following ingredients into the mixture:  tomato sauce, vinegar, mustard powder, and the liquid from the can of beans. It is important to cook the entire mixture in low to medium heat for a while so that optimum flavors can be extracted.",
      "The beans are added last, along with the molasses. These needs to cook for a few minutes, before serving your homemade pork and beans. The process is simple and straightforward, the taste is out-of-this-world, in a good way.",

It has been a comfort food for me every winter.

      "Oven Baked Leche Flan is a version of the popular Filipino leche flan dessert dish made by baking in the oven, instead of the traditional method of steaming. This creamy and delicious custard dish has a smooth texture and the right amount of sweetness.",
      "I like this method of cooking leche flan for many reasons. One reason has something to do with the type and size of mold that I can use. I am not limited to llanera any more; ramekins, cake pans, and other oven-safe molds can be used as long as these fits in the oven (just make sure that a large tray with water is under it to serve as water bath). This also means that I can cook more leche flan at the same time. It is ideal if you intend to serve flan to many people.",
      "I mentioned water bath earlier. This refers to a wide and somewhat deep container that you place your mold (with flan) into while baking. The idea is for the mold to be a bit submerged in water while baking to prevent the custard from cracking. When I am making several leche flans to serve to a large group, arranging the molds in roasting pans (like what I showed in the video below) sometimes do not work because I needed more roasting pans to submerge the molds into. What I do is fill-up a wide baking tray (18 x 26) with water and put it on the rack below where my multiple molds are arranged in the oven. The molds are not directly submerged in water, but it works.",

      "“Ampaw” was the first thing that came into my mind – but how can I make ampaw out of puffed rice cereals? I started thinking on possible sweet binders that I may use to hold the rice puffs together. I also did some research and found out that it was not as complicated as I was expecting. Since puffed rice cereals are already sweetened, I thought of using a liquid binder that is not too sweet. Light corn syrup was the best ingredient that I came-up along with some brown sugar to balance the sweetness.",
      "If you want just the right amount of sweetness, I suggest that you try using unsweetened popped rice instead of the boxed rice puff cereals. I tried using this recipe using Kellogg’s cocoa krispies and rice krispies– both turned out perfect.",

Instead of making the crust (graham crust) from scratch, I decided to get a ready-made graham pie crust from the local grocery store. We also bought a ready made cherry pie filling so that we can save more time in making the topping.

      "Biko is a Filipino rice cake made from sticky rice (locally known as malagkit), coconut milk, and brown sugar. Like other rice cakes, this is referred to as kakanin (derived from the word “kanin” which means rice) and is often eaten as dessert or meryenda (mid-afternoon snack).",
      "Traditionally, this delicious rice cake is placed over banana leaves in a bilao (round weaven bamboo tray) and garnished with latik (cooked coconut milk residue) on top. In addition, Biko is served during special occasions such as birthday parties, family reunions, and town fiestas.",
      "Try this simple yet delicious Biko recipe.",
      "This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy.",
      "Sticky, chewy, and oh so sweet, biko is a delicious treat that Filipinos all across the world enjoy. Biko is a type of sticky rice cake, otherwise known as kakanin. With a combination of coconut milk and brown sugar, biko is a delicious dessert or merienda to share with your loved ones! You can often find biko at birthday parties, fiestas, holiday parties, and family reunions, usually with other sticky rice treats.",
      "Filipinos love rice, but we also love coconuts. The sweet, unique flavor of coconut milk is one we use in a variety of dishes –– appetizers, entrees, and even desserts! Whatever you pair it with, coconut milk’s delicious flavor shines through –– another reason why biko is so one of a kind and absolutely yummy!",
      "If you’re worried about cooking this, you don’t have to be! The biko recipe we have today is simple, taking a little less than an hour with just a few ingredients. In addition, the biko we’re familiar with is served traditionally atop banana leaves in a bilao, or a round woven bamboo tray. However, because we want anyone to be able to make this recipe, all you need is a pot, a rice cooker, and a serving plate! Biko is so easy to make, you’ll be able to enjoy it at your dining table in no time!",
      "Biko is a type of kakanin, a group of glutinous rice cakes we love to have for merienda (snacks). The word itself is actually a combination of the words kanin (rice) and kain (eat)! We know there are many types of kakanin (does bibingka, puto, or sapin-sapin, among others, ring any bells?). But did you also know there are many types of biko? It’s true! You can enjoy this classic rice cake in a variety of ways, and each one is delicious! It all depends on your preference.",
      "As many twists as you can put on this traditional rice cake, you can never go wrong with the classic coconut milk sticky rice. Try this awesome recipe today.",
      "The only ingredients you’ll need for biko are sticky rice, water, brown sugar, coconut milk, and salt! See? Easy!",
      "Mix your sticky rice and water in a rice cooker and cook until your rice is ready. The small amount of water compared to the rice is intentional; this is because we don’t want the rice to be fully cooked! While the rice is cooking, combine 4 cups of the coconut milk with 2 cups of brown sugar and salt in a separate pot over the stove. Cook on low heat until the texture thickens, and continue to stir. Incorporate both ingredients well. The nutty, sweet smell of the coconut-sugar mixture is absolutely mouthwatering!",
      "Once your rice has finished cooking, add your cooked rice to the thick coconut milk-sugar mixture! Mix them well, letting the rice absorb the thick texture. Continue to cook it until all the liquid evaporates, but make sure not to overcook it!",
      "After you’ve fully cooked your biko, transfer it to a serving plate and make it flat. Hot, sticky, and sweet, your biko is now ready to be consumed! Share and enjoy it with loved ones over a hot cup of coffee or hot chocolate.",

      "Buko pandan is a beloved Filipino dessert that has been enjoyed in the Philippines since the early 20th century.",
      "This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy.",
      "It might resemble buko salad, but it has its unique flavor. Made with young coconut and pandan leaves, it has a unique flavor and vibrant green color. Its popularity endures because it’s simple to prepare and incredibly refreshing, making it a great choice for parties and special occasions.",
      "The ingredients for today’s recipe are pleasantly straightforward and can be easily found at local grocery stores or markets.",
      "While desserts from other countries, like Thailand’s buko pandan, also feature coconut and pandan, Filipino buko pandan stands out for its creamy and sweet taste, thanks to condensed milk and cream. In contrast, the Thai version is firmer and uses more coconut milk for flavor. Despite their differences, both desserts share common ingredients typical in Southeast Asian sweets.",
      "It’s important to let the mixture cool down before placing it in the refrigerator to avoid straining the appliance. Taking care of your refrigerator helps maintain its efficiency and prolongs its lifespan.",
      "As the weather warms up, such as in the Philippines where temperatures can reach up to 40°C, enjoying a cool and refreshing buko pandan is ideal. With just a few simple ingredients, you can easily make it at home. You might also like other Filipino desserts like fruit salad and halo-halo.",
      "To store buko pandan, place it in an airtight container and refrigerate it. It will usually stay good for 3 to 5 days. If you want to keep it longer, you can freeze it, but the texture of the coconut and jelly may change. Always check for unusual smells or changes in texture before eating, as these could be signs that the buko pandan has gone bad.",

      "Polvoron is a semi-sweet Filipino treat made from toasted flour, powdered milk, sugar, and butter. Its name comes from the Spanish word “polvo,” which means “powder,” highlighting its crumbly texture.",
      "This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy.",
      "The recipe for polvoron arrived in the Philippines during Spanish colonial times and has since become a popular local snack. While it retains its basic ingredients, Filipino versions often include unique additions like pinipig (roasted rice puffs) or nuts, which give it a distinctive flavor. Pinipig is also used in halo-halo, another popular Filipino dessert.",
      "Begin by heating a frying pan or wok over medium heat. Add 4 cups of all-purpose flour to the pan. Toast the flour, stirring continuously until it develops a light brown color and releases a pleasant aroma. This process enhances the flavor and gives the polvoron a slightly nutty taste. Be careful not to let it burn.",
      "Once toasted, remove the pan from the heat and let the flour cool for about 20 minutes. After cooling, transfer the flour to a mixing bowl. Next, add 2 cups of powdered milk and stir with a balloon whisk until well combined. The powdered milk adds creaminess and helps bind the ingredients together.",
      "After mixing the milk, incorporate 1½ cups of granulated sugar into the bowl. Stir well to ensure the sugar evenly distributes throughout the mixture. Then, add ¾ cup of crushed pinipig, which is roasted rice puffs. This ingredient adds a delightful crunch and traditional Filipino flavor to your polvoron.",
      "Next, pour in 1 ⅛ cups of softened butter and mix thoroughly. You can use a spoon or your clean hands to combine the ingredients at this stage, ensuring everything blends well. Allow the mixture to sit for at least 10 minutes. This resting time helps the butter cool slightly, improving the binding of the polvoron.",
      "Finally, using a polvoron molder, scoop out the mixture and place it onto pre-cut Japanese paper or cellophane. Wrap each piece tightly to secure the shape. Your delicious polvoron is now ready to serve. Share and enjoy this delightful treat with family and friends!",
      "Polvoron brings back memories of town fiestas. As a child, I enjoyed taking part in different contests at our town’s fiesta, including a whistling challenge where we had to eat a piece of a dessert candy called polvoron or puto seco (Filipino cookies made from glutinous rice and cornstarch) before we could whistle. The first person to make a sound won the game. Let’s make this classic treat at home!",
      "I haven’t made polvoron in years because I didn’t have a mold. Fortunately, a friend brought one back for me from her vacation in the Philippines. With the ingredients we used, I was able to make around 60 pieces of polvoron!",
      "There are many different versions of this dessert candy you can find these days, including cookies and cream, peanut, chocolate, and more. The recipe we’re using here is the classic and simplest version.",
      "Making desserts or snacks like this is different from cooking regular dishes because missing an ingredient can significantly affect the final texture and taste. So, be sure to include everything listed in the ingredients below.",
      "To wrap polvoron, start by placing a portion of the mixture onto a piece of wax paper or cellophane. Use small plastic molds that press and seal the polvoron, making the wrapping process simpler and giving it a neat appearance. Next, fold the edges of the paper or cellophane over the polvoron and twist the ends to seal it. For a more decorative touch, you can use colorful wrappers or ribbons. Wrapping it tightly helps keep the polvoron fresh and maintains its shape. Alternatively, you can",

      "Cassava Cake is a classic Filipino dessert made from grated cassava (manioc).  Cassava is also known as  kamoteng kahoy and balinghoy in the Philippines. Cassava starch is also used to make tapioca. There are different cassava cake around, but this Cassava Cake Recipe is by far, the best that I have had.",
      "This post may contain affiliate links. Please read our disclosure policy.",
      "I was able to taste several versions of Cassava Cake when I am still in the Philippines. I remember back then — when I was still younger — almost all the vacant lots in our subdivision have either banana trees planted or kamoteng kahoy. We used to cut the trunk of the cassava plant to use as the foundation of our bahay-bahayan (play house). When it’s time for meryenda (mid afternoon snack), boiled cassava is always present. I like to dip my boiled cassava in sugar. When it comes to making cassava cake, I like to do the cooking (or baking) part, not the preparation. Since fresh cassava is dug  from the ground, the people assigned in preparing the cassava needs to do the digging, cleaning, peeling, and shredding. Now you know why I chose to do the cooking part.",
      "This recipe for cassava cake consists of two (2) processes. The first is making the cassava batter, and the second is preparing the topping.",
      "Let’s start with the batter. Combine the grated cassava, butter, milk, a portion of the cheese, sugar, eggs, and coconut milk in a mixing bowl. Use a wire whist to mix all the ingredients together. This step will only take a couple of minutes to complete.",
      "You will need to grab a baking pan and grease it with oil. You can simply spray cooking oil such as Pam, or you can pour around 1 teaspoon of oil and spread it using your fingers. Pour the cassava mixture to the baking pan. At this point, the oven should have been preheated.",
      "Bake the cassava cake until done. While waiting, you can start preparing the topping. This is a simple process, simply mix all the topping ingredients as seen in the recipe below and cook until the texture gets thick. Once the cassava cake is done baking, pour the topping over and spread. Top with extra cheese and bake again for a few minutes until the top gets nice and brown.",
      "This cassava cake recipe is my personal favorite. It is not until the time when I came here in the US that I was able to try the best cassava cake. I wish that  was exaggerating, but I am not. This cassava cake recipe is really great because it tastes good, it is rich, and very easy to prepare. The credit goes to our good friend, Sharon, who was kind enough to share her cassava cake recipe to us. So I asked for her permission to share the recipe with you, and she agreed. So here we are now with this Cassava Cake Recipe for everyone’s enjoyment.",
      "One of the most delightful aspects of every meal is, without question, the scrumptious dessert that ends it. Cassava cake is one of my absolute favorite desserts, as it’s not only trademark Filipino but also incredibly delicious. The perfect blend of cheesy, buttery, and nutty, this cake melts in your mouth, letting you fully enjoy the harmonious intermingling of flavors. It’s a delightful and hearty way to finish up a fantastic meal –– and one you can bring to potlucks, too!",
      "With Latin American roots, cassava was first introduced to the Philippines some time in the 16th century. Many also point out that this dish was a native of Lucban, Quezon. Other names this dessert goes by include:",
      "However you call it, though, the description of this wonderful dessert remains the same. The mix of cassava, milk, egg whites, and cheese produce a cake that is chewy and somewhat firm in nature, but still manages to soften in your mouth.",
      "You may be surprised to find out that this sweet and decadent dessert actually stems from a root crop, not unlike sweet potatoes or yams! Cassava is a rich and affordable carb that has found a home in many cuisines across the entire world. In fact, more than 80 countries are proud to call cassava their natives, growing in countries that are mostly tropical in climate.",
      "However, it’s important to note that you should never eat cassava raw. Without cooking it thoroughly, the plant contains traces of cyanide, which may be dangerous to your health. Cassava is great for withstanding volatile temperatures and climates, but is also quite susceptible to many infections.",
      "Baking and boiling are the most common ways of enjoying this tasty vegetable. But apart from those ways, and the yummy cassava cake, here are other things you can make from this root crop:",
      "Whether you’re using cassava flour only or a mix of both cassava and wheat flour, making your own bread is a somewhat long but worthwhile experience. If you opt for the former, this bread is inherently gluten-free, nut-free, and Paleo diet friendly. It can also be yeast and dairy-free (although not vegan). Like cassava cake, bread is a wonderful thing to make at home. Additionally, you can even turn this into a fun family activity for everyone.",
      "Cassava isn’t just good for sweet treats like cassava cake. For instance: who doesn’t love french fries? Whether you’re snacking on them on their own or with a sandwich or burger, they’re definitely a nice treat to fill you up. By substituting your usual potatoes with cassava, you have fries or wedges that are not only healthier but taste just as, or even more delicious! You can choose to deep fry them or bake them, but either way you can enjoy these goodies with ketchup on the side.",
      "If you’re a fan of mashed potatoes, then you will also enjoy this mashed cassava! While a far cry from the sweet cassava cake, this savory side will fill you up as well as any cup of rice or plate of noodles can. Mashed cassava works as well as mashed potatoes with a nice heaping gravy poured all over it. I enjoy this mashed cassava with meat dishes like steak or pork chops, as well as a lovely crispy fried chicken. Eaters young and old will really enjoy this dish!",
      "Lastly, tapioca is another way of enjoying this classic crop in a sweet way, apart from our beloved cassava cake. Tapioca is a starch you can get from the roots of the cassava plant. Thick and gelatinous in texture, tapioca is popular as chips or even jelly. Tapioca pudding is a popular option in many Southeast Asian countries –– a lot like sticky rice pudding. And of course, if you are a boba tea fan, tapioca pearls are an absolute staple. You can’t call boba tea boba tea without them!"
